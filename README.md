# ExploringDataWithGraphs

This directory contains several R scripts showing utilization of ggplot2 to create scatter, bar, line, histogram, 
and density plots. The datasets used in these scripts are available as part of Andy Field's Discovering Statistics Using R
companion website here: https://studysites.sagepub.com/dsur/study/articles.htm. The datasets can be found under the Chapter 4
section.

##R Dependencies
The available scripts are written in **R version 3.5.0**.

Install ggplot2 and the reshape packages needed to run components of these scripts:
```
install.packages("ggplot2","reshape")
